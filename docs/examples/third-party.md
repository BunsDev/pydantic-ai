# Third Party / Miscellaneous Examples

There are an abundance of great `pydantic-ai` examples in the wild. This page is a collection
of some great examples (often using third party tools) that don't fit into the scope of our standard examples.

## Gradio

You can build multi-turn chat applications for your agent with [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/), a framework for building AI web applications entirely in python. Gradio comes with built-in chat components and agent support so the entire UI will be implemented in a single python file!
